So far I am trying to implement both the board and player classes in order to have interaction between the two. I am currently dealing with issues as such: 
1. I am unsure how to go about creating each location with specificed variables, such as (isOwned, price, rent, etc.) I believe using inheritance from a generic 
location method would be the best option, I have yet to implement it yet.
